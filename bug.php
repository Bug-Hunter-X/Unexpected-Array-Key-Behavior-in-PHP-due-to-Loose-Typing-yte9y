In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["foo"] = 1;
$myArray[1] = 2;
echo $myArray[0]; //Notice the unexpected output
```

PHP's loose typing allows for automatic key casting and type juggling. In this example, `$myArray[0]` will produce a value, even though it wasn't explicitly defined. PHP will cast the numeric key '0' to an integer before accessing the array.  This might lead to unexpected values or unexpected behavior  if you rely on an array's keys being strictly defined and you're not expecting this behavior.

This is different from languages that enforce strict key types; you'd typically receive an error or null value.

Another similar case arises with non-numeric strings used as keys.  If you accidentally use keys with subtle differences in casing or leading/trailing whitespace, you might encounter unexpected results when accessing values.

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["  name  "] = "John";
$myArray["name"] = "Jane";
echo $myArray["name"]; // May produce unexpected results
```
